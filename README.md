# Xamarin.WindowView  

**Xamarin.WindowView is just a rough port to C# of [justasm's WindowView](https://github.com/justasm/WindowView)**, in fact, I copied his readme too!

WindowView
==========

*Window as in windowsill.*

![Tilting to pan images.](/sample/sample_in_action.gif)

A Xamarin.Android `ImageView` that can be panned around by tilting your device, as if you were looking
through a window.

Usage
-----
Add it to your project using NuGet:

```
Install-Package Xamarin.WindowView -Pre
```

Use in place of an `ImageView`. Example XML layout file:

```xml
<Jmedeisis.WindowView.WindowView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:src="@drawable/my_image" />
```

Please refer to the included [sample application project](Example/) for a complete example.

Configuration
-------------
You will typically want to configure the following attributes for the `WindowView` class:

- `wwv_max_pitch` - maximum angle (in degrees) from origin for vertical device tilts.
*Default - 30&deg;*

- `wwv_max_roll` - maximum angle (in degrees) from origin for horizontal device tilts.
*Default - 30&deg;*

- `wwv_vertical_origin` - (in degrees) when device pitch equals this value, the image is centered
vertically. *Default - 0&deg;*

- `wwv_horizontal_origin` - (in degrees) when device roll equals this value, the image is centered
horizontally. *Default - 0&deg;*

You may also want to configure more advanced attributes:

- `wwv_orientation_mode` - `Absolute` or `Relative` (default). Specifies whether device tilt should
be tracked with respect to `Absolute` world coordinates (i.e. pitch, roll w.r.t. ground plane) or
with respect to the device orientation when `WindowView` is created, which `WindowView` refers to as
the 'orientation origin'. If using the latter, i.e. `Relative`, you may use
`WindowView#resetOrientationOrigin(boolean)` to set the orientation origin to that of the device
when the method is called.

- `wwv_translate_mode` - `Constant` or `Proportional` (default). Specifies how much the image is
translated in response to device tilt. If `Proportional`, the image moves within the full range
defined by `max_pitch` / `max_roll`, with the extremities of the image visible when device pitch /
roll is at those angles. If `Constant`, the image moves a constant amount per unit of tilt which is
defined by `max_constant_translation`, achieved when pitch / roll are at `max_pitch` / `max_roll`.

- `wwv_max_constant_translation` - see above. *Default - 150dp*

- `wwv_sensor_sampling_period` - the desired rate of sensor events. In microseconds or one of
`fast`, `normal` (default) or `slow`. If using microsecond values, higher values result in slower
sensor updates. Directly related to the rate at which `WindowView` updates in response to device
tilt.

- `wwv_tilt_sensor_mode` - `Manual` or `Automatic` (default). Specifies whether `WindowView` is
responsible for when tilt motion tracking starts and stops. If `Automatic`, `WindowView` works out
of the box and requires no extra configuration. If `Manual`, you must explicitly start and stop tilt
motion tracking. You have two options:
    * Use `WindowView#startTiltTracking()` and `WindowView#stopTiltTracking()`, e.g. in your
    `Activity`'s `onResume()` and `onPause()`, respectively.

    * Use `WindowView#attachTiltTracking(TiltSensor)` and
    `WindowView#detachTiltTracking(TiltSensor)`. This approach is recommended when using multiple
    `WindowView`s in a single logical layout. The externally managed `TiltSensor` should be started
    and stopped using `TiltSensor#startTracking(int)` and `TiltSensor#stopTracking()` as appropriate.

Example configuration:

```xml
<Jmedeisis.WindowView.WindowView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:src="@drawable/my_image"
    app:wwv_tilt_sensor_mode="Manual"
    app:wwv_orientation_mode="Relative"
    app:wwv_translate_mode="Constant"
    app:wwv_max_constant_translation="100dp"
    app:wwv_sensor_sampling_period="fast"
    app:wwv_max_pitch="15"
    app:wwv_max_roll="15"
    app:wwv_vertical_origin="0"
    app:wwv_horizontal_origin="0" />
```

Limitations
-----------
- Only supports the CENTER_CROP scale type.
- ~~Works for API levels 9+.~~

Development
-----------
Pull requests are welcome and encouraged for bugfixes and features such as:

- adaptive smoothing filters tuned for different sensor accuracy and rates
- bi-directional image panning
